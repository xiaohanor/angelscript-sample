/* The FHazeConstrainedPhysicsValue struct can be used to add a bit of juiciness and believability to objects
	that are expected to behave in a physical way. Examples are springs, catapults, buttons, levers etc.

	No ACTUAL physics is applied, its just math :) So if you want collisions, reactions with objects, you
	have to implement that yourself in some way.

	The numbers are a bit hand-wavy and hard to visualize, so I recommend just playing around with them until
	you get the behaviour that you're looking for! With experience, you will get a feel for the numbers. */
